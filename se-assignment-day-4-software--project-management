3.Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each#
Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies
Agile Methodology
- **Description:** An iterative approach that evolves through collaboration.
- **Advantages:**
  - Flexible and adapts to changes easily.
  - Regular client involvement for better feedback.
  - Faster delivery of working increments.
  - Improved quality through ongoing testing.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Less predictable timelines and budgets.
  - Requires strong teamwork and communication.
  - May have less comprehensive documentation.
Waterfall Methodology
- **Description:** A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on.
- **Advantages:**
  - Clear structure and easy management.
  - Predictable timelines and budgets.
  - Emphasizes thorough documentation.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Inflexible to changes once the project starts.
  - Late testing can lead to costly fixes.
  - Risk of not meeting user needs if requirements are misunderstood.
In summary, Agile is flexible and customer-focused but can be unpredictable, while Waterfall is structured and predictable but inflexible to changes.



In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial
- **Projects:** 
  1. **Software Development:** Ideal for projects with changing requirements (e.g., a startup developing a mobile app).
  2. **Product Development:** Suited for innovation with customer input (e.g., a tech company adding new features based on user testing).
When Waterfall is More Beneficial
- **Projects:**
  1. **Construction and Manufacturing:** Clear requirements and structured phases are essential (e.g., building a bridge).
  2. **Regulatory Projects:** Critical for compliance and documentation (e.g., software for healthcare or finance).
Agile works best for flexible projects needing frequent feedback, while Waterfall is better for projects with clear requirements and strict phases.
